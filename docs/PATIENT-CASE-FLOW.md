# Patient / Case Flow Documentation

This document describes the end-to-end flow of a patient case in the Mediend CRM, covering both **Insurance** and **Cash** paths, all **Pipeline Stages**, **Case Stages**, forms, fields, permissions, and the downstream **P&L** and **Outstanding** modules.

---

## 1. Data Model Overview

There is **no separate Patient table**. The `Lead` model is the central entity — patient identity, demographics, clinical, and commercial data all live on it. Every downstream record hangs off `leadId` (all 1:1 unique):

```
Lead
 ├── KYPSubmission (1:1) ── PreAuthorization (1:1) ── HospitalSuggestion[] ── InsuranceQuery[]
 ├── InsuranceCase (1:1)
 ├── InsuranceInitiateForm (1:1)
 ├── AdmissionRecord (1:1)
 ├── DischargeSheet (1:1) ──optional──> PLRecord
 ├── PLRecord (1:1)
 ├── OutstandingCase (1:1)
 ├── CaseStageHistory[]
 └── CaseChatMessage[]
```

## 2. Two Axes: Pipeline Stage vs Case Stage

| Concept | Purpose | Values |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Pipeline Stage** | High-level business funnel — drives which dashboard the case appears on | `SALES`, `INSURANCE`, `PL`, `COMPLETED`, `LOST` |
| **Case Stage** | Granular workflow state — drives which actions are allowed and permissions | See full enum below |
| **Flow Type** | Determines insurance vs cash path | `INSURANCE`, `CASH` |

---

## 3. Case Stage Enum (Full List)

### Insurance Flow Stages

| Case Stage | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `NEW_LEAD` | Lead created; no KYP yet |
| `KYP_BASIC_PENDING` | KYP basic form needs to be filled by BD |
| `KYP_BASIC_COMPLETE` | BD has submitted KYP basic; Insurance can suggest hospitals |
| `KYP_DETAILED_PENDING` | Insurance KYP details pending (legacy/alternate) |
| `KYP_DETAILED_COMPLETE` | Insurance KYP details complete (legacy/alternate) |
| `KYP_PENDING` | Legacy alias for KYP in progress |
| `KYP_COMPLETE` | Legacy alias for KYP complete |
| `HOSPITALS_SUGGESTED` | Insurance has suggested hospitals; BD can raise pre-auth |
| `PREAUTH_RAISED` | BD has raised pre-auth; Insurance must approve/reject |

| `OUTSTANDING` | Case has outstanding payments/follow-up |

### Cash Flow Stages

| Case Stage | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `CASH_IPD_PENDING` | Cash mode started; BD needs to fill IPD cash form |

---

## 4. Pipeline Stage Transitions

| Pipeline Stage | When It's Set | Who Cares |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| `SALES` | Default when lead is created / synced | BD, Team Lead, Sales |
| `INSURANCE` | When hospital suggestions are submitted (`POST /api/kyp/pre-auth`) | Insurance team |
| `PL` | When discharge sheet is created (auto-creates PLRecord), or manual "Create PNL", or insurance case approved | PL team |
| `COMPLETED` | Manual or business logic (e.g. both payouts PAID on PL edit) | Reporting, MD |
| `LOST` | BD marks lead as lost (`POST /api/leads/:id/mark-lost`) | Reporting |

---

## 5. End-to-End Insurance Flow (Step by Step)

### 5.1 Lead Creation (`SALES`, `NEW_LEAD`)

- Lead is created with `pipelineStage = SALES`, `caseStage = NEW_LEAD`.
- BD / Team Lead owns the lead (`lead.bdId`).

---

## 6. Cash Flow (Alternate Path)

BD can switch a lead to cash mode at early stages. This bypasses the full insurance pre-auth/approval flow.

**Start Cash Mode:** `PATCH /api/leads/[id]` — sets `flowType: CASH`, `caseStage: CASH_IPD_PENDING`
**Revert to Insurance:** Same PATCH — sets `flowType: INSURANCE`, reverts to `KYP_BASIC_COMPLETE` or `NEW_LEAD`

### 6.1 Fill IPD Cash Form — BD

## 7. P&L Dashboard

### 7.1 How a case enters PL

- **Automatically:** When Insurance creates a Discharge Sheet → PLRecord auto-created, `pipelineStage → PL`, PL team notified
- **Manually:** "Create PNL Record" button on `DischargeSheetView` calls `POST /api/discharge-sheet/[id]/create-pnl` (PL_HEAD, INSURANCE_HEAD, ADMIN) — creates PLRecord if none exists, links to discharge sheet
- **Cash:** `POST /api/discharge-sheet-cash` also creates PLRecord

### 7.2 PLRecord Fields

**Editable on `/pl/record/[leadId]`** (via `PATCH /api/leads/[id]` with `{ plRecord: {...} }`):

| Section | Field | Type |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Identity** | month, surgeryDate, status, paymentType, approvedOrCash, paymentCollectedAt | date/text |
| **People** | managerRole, managerName, bdmName, patientName, patientPhone, doctorName, hospitalName | text |
| **Case** | category, treatment, circle, leadSource | text |
| **Financials** | totalAmount, billAmount, cashPaidByPatient, cashOrDedPaid | number |
| **Cost Lines** | referralAmount, cabCharges, implantCost, dcCharges, doctorCharges | number |
| **Revenue Split** | hospitalSharePct / hospitalShareAmount | number |
| | mediendSharePct / mediendShareAmount | number |
| **Profit** | mediendNetProfit, finalProfit | number |
| **Payout Tracking** | hospitalPayoutStatus | `PENDING` / `PARTIAL` / `PAID` |
| | doctorPayoutStatus | `PENDING` / `PARTIAL` / `PAID` |
| | mediendInvoiceStatus | `PENDING` / `SENT` / `PAID` |
| | hospitalAmountPending, doctorAmountPending | number |
| **Meta** | remarks, closedAt | text / date |

### 7.3 Profit Calculation (on PL edit save)

```
hospAmount = billAmount × hospitalSharePct / 100  (or manual hospitalShareAmount)
medAmount  = billAmount × mediendSharePct / 100   (or manual mediendShareAmount)
costs      = referralAmount + cabCharges + dcCharges + doctorCharges + implantCost
netProfit  = medAmount - costs
mediendNetProfit = manual override OR netProfit
closedAt auto-set when hospitalPayoutStatus + doctorPayoutStatus both = PAID
```

### 7.4 PL Dashboard

- **Page:** `/pl/dashboard`
- **Who:** PL_HEAD, ADMIN
- **Data:** Leads with `pipelineStage` in `[PL, COMPLETED]`, date-filtered
- **KPIs:** Sum of `finalProfit`, average ticket size, pending payout counts

## 14. 8-Step Stage Progress (UI Component)

The `StageProgress` component (`components/case/stage-progress.tsx`) shows these 8 steps visually on the patient page:

| # | Step | Actor | Color |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Insurance Card Details (KYP) | BD | Blue |
| 2 | Suggest Hospitals | Insurance | Purple |
| 3 | Pre-Auth Raise | BD | Blue |
| 4 | Pre-Auth Approval | Insurance | Purple |
| 5 | Insurance Initial Form | Insurance | Purple |
| 6 | IPD Details (Mark Admitted) | BD | Blue |
| 7 | IPD Mark (Status Update) | BD | Blue |
| 8 | Discharge Summary | Insurance | Purple |

Cash flow uses `CashStageProgress` with 4 steps: IPD Cash Form → Insurance Review → Approved → Discharge.
